This guide walks you through the process of creating a "Hello, World" RESTful web
service with Spring.
It's a personal copy of the repository [gs-rest-service](https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-rest-service): please refer it for the technical explications.

In my repo, I show some personal modify and I show how I manage my Git workflow with hotfix and features.
